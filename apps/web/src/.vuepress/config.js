// The site's name — the one place it is spelled. SITE_NAME is the rename
// seam: a product built from this baseline gets its own display name written
// here, and VuePress puts it in every page's <title>, beside the logo in the
// navbar and as the home page's heading.
//
// The template's source ships no .vuepress/config.js: built as it is, the
// site is titled "VuePress" (VuePress's own default), with no navbar links
// and no sidebar. Vercel's live example of the template runs the config
// create-vuepress-site generates; this file restores the parts of it that
// change the site — its title, its head tags, the navbar and the guide's
// sidebar. (The rest of that config only restates VuePress's defaults.)

# vuepress-boilerplate

A VuePress docs site — the home page with its hero and features, a guide
under its sidebar and a config reference, under the navbar — built with
[VuePress](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org) 1, fully static, and served as
**Cloudflare Workers + Static Assets** behind one small Worker.

## Live deployment

<!-- 03-docs:begin -->
This site is **live**. Verified URLs, identity and the secrets it uses are
recorded in [ai/context/deployment.md](ai/context/deployment.md) (re-rendered
by the `03-docs` phase); how it deploys and how to operate it:
[ai/context/operations.md](ai/context/operations.md).
<!-- 03-docs:end -->

## What is here

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| The site's name, head tags, navbar and sidebars | `apps/web/src/.vuepress/config.js` |
| The pages, as Markdown: the home page, the guide, the config reference | `apps/web/src/` |
| The Worker in front of the static files, and the deploy contract | `apps/web/worker/index.ts`, `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`, `apps/web/component.yaml` |
| Tests of the config, the Worker, the pages and the built site | `tests/web` (vitest) |

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test             # the vitest suite, after vuepress build
pnpm build            # vuepress build src → apps/web/src/.vuepress/dist
```

```bash
pnpm --filter @app/web dev        # vuepress dev on http://localhost:3000, reloading as you edit
pnpm --filter @app/web preview    # wrangler dev over the built site, as the Worker serves it
```

Add a page by adding a Markdown file under `apps/web/src/` (`guide/deploy.md`
is `/guide/deploy.html`, `about/README.md` is `/about/`): `vuepress build`
writes it as its own HTML file, and an address that matches no page is
answered with VuePress's 404 page and a 404 status. List a new guide page in
the sidebar, or add a navbar link, in `apps/web/src/.vuepress/config.js`,
where the site's name is too. The pages are VuePress's placeholders: replace
them to start.

## How it deploys

Merges to `main` converge through [Orun](https://github.com/sourceplane/orun):
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` plans the changed components and runs each lane
against the workspace in `intent.yaml`. The site deploys to `stage`, then to
`prod` once stage has converged on the same commit; `dev` only verifies. The
Worker is `vuepress-boilerplate-web-<env>` on your account's workers.dev
subdomain, and every deploy is smoke-tested over HTTP: the home page must be
VuePress's, the app script it names must be served, the guide must answer at
`/guide/` and `/guide/using-vue.html`, and a page that does not exist must
be the 404 page with a 404 status. A pull request runs the same pipeline's
verify lanes: the site built and dry-deployed for each environment, with
nothing deployed. They do not lint or run the tests, so run `pnpm
typecheck`, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before you push. (A push to `main`
builds, deploys and smoke-tests.) If you replace the guide, change the
smoke in `apps/web/component.yaml` with it.

The pipeline holds one credential, GitHub's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The
Cloudflare token and account id are brokered per run from the workspace's
Cloudflare connection; nothing provider-shaped is stored in the repository
or in GitHub.

**Deploy by hand.** Orunbase's **Deploy** button on a component, or **Run
workflow** on the CI workflow in GitHub's Actions tab (on `main`), runs
`ci.yml` for the environment and components you pick, and each one deploys
exactly as a merge would deploy it. Leave the component blank to redeploy
every component in that environment, with nothing changed: after rotating a
secret, say. A component with nothing to run in that environment (a test
suite in `prod`) is left out with a notice.

## Custom domain

The site answers on workers.dev from its first deploy. To serve it on your
own domain:

1. Add the domain to the Cloudflare account the site deploys into, and
   attach it to the Worker (dashboard → Workers & Pages →
   `vuepress-boilerplate-web-prod` → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add →
   Custom domain). Do the same for stage with a subdomain if you want one.
2. Record the environment's public origin in `intent.yaml`. VuePress writes
   no absolute URL, so the build does not read it; the deployment record
   probes the domain beside the workers.dev URL:

   ```yaml
   environments:
     prod:
       env:
         SITE_URL: https://vuepress-boilerplate.example.com
   ```

   The site was born with the reserved placeholder
   `vuepress-boilerplate.example.com` where its domain goes: that example,
   and `BASE_DOMAIN` under each environment (dev, stage and prod) in
   `intent.yaml`. Replace it with your domain in the same change.
